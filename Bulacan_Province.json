    "write-ups":"Bulacan prides itself for its rich historical heritage. In 1899, the historic Barasoain Church in Malolos City (Bulacan's capital city) is the birthplace of the First Constitutional Democracy in Asia.
    Bulacan is also the cradle of the nation's noble heroes, of great men and women; among them: Marcelo H. del Pilar—'The Great Propagandist,'and General Gregorio del Pilar'—The Hero of Tirad Pass.'
    Bulacan is also home to many of the country's greatest artists, with a good number elevated as National Artists; among them: the legendary poet Francisco 'Baltazar' Balagtas, the musician Nicanor Abelardo, and the nationalist sculptor Guillermo Tolentino.
    Today, Bulacan is among the most progressive provinces in the Philippines. Its people - the Bulakeño (or Bulakenyo) - are highly educated, enterprising and industrious."
